=========

Project site and blog are available at http://thunder-ex.github.io/.

**NOTE:** Thunder is pre-alpha software. It's not likely that it could help you with developing your application. However if you are interesting in learning Elixir or web framework development you came to the right place.

## Development

After cloning repository you would need to perform very standard steps for mix project. I will also note them below:

1. Clone repo
2. Run `mix deps.get`
3. Just to meke sure that everything is fine you can run `mix test`
3. Run `iex -S mix`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` from your browser

## Contributing

Of course all contibutions are welcome. Features, bug fixes, documentation, blogging etc. If you are interested in contributing but you are unsure what would be good thing to work on feel free to ask on [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thunder-talk) or [send me an email](https://github.com/darkofabijan). If you are interesting in what has been developed so far please check [blog](http://thunder-ex.github.io/). I also tend to be systematic on development in a way that I create pull request so all new code can be discusses and referenced in blog posts. 

## License

I set it to MIT without much insight into licensing. It will stay like that until I do a bit more research in that area.
